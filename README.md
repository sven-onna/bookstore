## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3

Clone this repository:

```shell

Change into the cloned repository and create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html "Link explaining how to create a venv"):

```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Install all requirements with `pip`:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the application:

```python
